<p> Thousands of homeless people are facing a new normal that puts them at imminent risk of contracting COVID-19. According to an analysis published in June 2020 by the Coalition for the Homeless, the risk of dying from COVID-19 is 61% higher for a homeless person compared to the rest of the population.</p>

 <p>At the peak of the pandemic, De Blasio's administration signed a $300 million contract with the hotel industry to temporarily house 10 thousand homeless people around the city.</p>

    <p>The NY Doctors Coalition emphasized that moving people to bunk-style shelters "directly threatens the health of thousands of homeless new yorkers, and indirectly that of the entire city". The order by De Blasio ran counter to CDC guidelines.</p>
